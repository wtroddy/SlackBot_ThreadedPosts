# ThreadedRSS: SlackBot for Threaded Posts

This is a collection of python scripts that supports interfacing with the slack app API to post to channels as a bot. The primary use case (and inspiration) for this was to post an RSS feed as threaded replies to a single post, rather than posting many messages each day. Although, it has some flexibility and can act as an interface to any of the Slack API methods.
